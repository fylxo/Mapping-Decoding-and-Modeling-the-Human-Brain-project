Introduction (taken from the Portfolio):


Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful tool for mapping neural activity, allowing to investigate the functional architecture of the human brain. 
Over the past decades, fMRI analysis techniques have evolved from traditional block-design approaches to sophisticated multivariate and encoding models.

This portfolio presents a structured exploration of fMRI data analysis, covering preprocessing, statistical modeling, and classification-based decoding techniques.
Through a series of project works, the following core topics are addressed:
 • Project Work 1: Understanding and visualizing the structure of the dataset, constructing design
 matrices, and preprocessing fMRI data.
 • Project Work 2: Implementing the General Linear Model (GLM) to compute contrast maps and
 perform region-of-interest (ROI) analyses.
 • Project Work 3: Applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) and classification techniques to
 decode object categories from fMRI data.
 • Project Work 4: Performing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to explore how different
 stimulus categories are encoded in the brain.
 • Project Work 5: Attempting voxel receptive field (vRF) modeling to estimate voxel-level selectivity,
 and discussing dataset constraints for such analyses.
 
The dataset (Haxby 2001) is used across all projects, providing a common framework for comparing different fMRI analysis approaches.
The methods range from univariate GLM-based contrasts to multivariate decoding and similarity-based techniques, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each.
By exploring these methods, this portfolio aims to demonstrate how different computational tools contribute to the broader goal of mapping, decoding, and modeling brain function.
