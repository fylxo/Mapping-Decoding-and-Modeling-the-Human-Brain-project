# fMRI Data Analysis Portfolio

## Introduction

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful technique for mapping neural activity and investigating the functional architecture of the human brain. Over the past few decades, fMRI analysis methods have evolved significantly, advancing from traditional block-design experiments to sophisticated multivariate and encoding models.

This portfolio presents a comprehensive exploration of fMRI data analysis, focusing on preprocessing, statistical modeling, and classification-based decoding techniques. Through a series of project works, key methodologies in contemporary fMRI analysis are addressed.

## Project Overview

### **Project Work 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Understanding and visualizing the structure of the dataset.
- Constructing design matrices.
- Preprocessing fMRI data.

### **Project Work 2: Statistical Modeling with GLM**
- Implementing the General Linear Model (GLM).
- Computing contrast maps.
- Performing region-of-interest (ROI) analyses.

### **Project Work 3: Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA)**
- Applying MVPA techniques.
- Using classification methods to decode object categories from fMRI data.

### **Project Work 4: Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)**
- Exploring representational structures in the brain.
- Investigating how different stimulus categories are encoded.

### **Project Work 5: Voxel Receptive Field (vRF) Modeling**
- Estimating voxel-level selectivity through vRF modeling.
- Discussing dataset limitations and constraints for receptive field modeling.

## Dataset

All projects are based on the **Haxby et al. (2001)** dataset (downloaded from http://data.pymvpa.org/datasets/haxby2001/), providing a consistent framework to compare and contrast various analysis approaches.

## Methods and Goals

This portfolio spans a range of methods, including:
- **Univariate analyses** using GLM-based contrasts.
- **Multivariate decoding** techniques such as MVPA.
- **Similarity-based analyses** like RSA.
- **Model-based approaches** including voxel receptive field modeling.

Each project highlights the strengths and limitations of the applied methods. The overarching goal is to demonstrate how different computational tools contribute to mapping, decoding, and modeling brain function in cognitive neuroscience.
